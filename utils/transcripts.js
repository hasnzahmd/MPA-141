Upon examination, the findings indicate elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat. The initial diagnosis is hypertension, likely exacerbated by stress. We have prescribed lisinopril ten milligrams daily for blood pressure management and metaprolol fifty milligrams twice daily to control the heart rate. Additionally, I recommend a patient undergoes an echocardiogram next week to assess any underlying cardiac issues. For dietary adjustments, the patient should reduce sodium intake and incorporate more potassium rich foods like bananas and spinach into their diet as part of his therapy. Daily thirty minute walks are advised to improve cardiovascular health. Please follow up in two weeks to review the results of the echocardiogram and adjust the treatment plan if necessary.",
